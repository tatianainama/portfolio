Prescient Traveler is a platform for monitoring and assisting people who are traveling around the world.

The platform consists of a mobile application made using Ionic, a web monitoring dashboard made in AngularJS using Mapbox and a custom CMS application.

The mobile application was used by the travelers to inform themselves about the area, from customs and traditions to safe/unsafe areas. They also received alerts and notifications of currents affairs of the zone.

The dashboard was used in the control center. It consisted of a worldwide map that displayed travelers' movement around the globe and potential dangerous/risk zones around them.

Finally, the backoffice CMS was used to generate content for the mobile application about customs and data about their itinerary destinations.

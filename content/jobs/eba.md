ESPECIFICOS Buenos Aires is a skin care company from Argentina.

I've worked with them as a Frontend Developer / Graphic Designer since 2014.

Most of my responsibilities as a designer were to create and update packaging templates and mock-ups, designing templates for emails and lettering and implement graphics for marketing.

As a developer, I've designed and developed their current marketing website. I've also helped developing an educational platform that streamed online courses to latin american students.

The online platform allowed students to read course's material, take surveys and exams and interact with their teachers.

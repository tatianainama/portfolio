Voices of Merseyside is a project for a graduate thesis research that explores the accents, dialects and identities of people of the Merseyside region.

The project consisted of two applications:

1. Multi-platform survey: survey with questions that allowed participants to draw shapes around the different areas of Merseyside and assign requested data about those places.

2. Admin panel: dashboard that performed statistical analysis on the surveys' data, that allowed the researcher to export results in a friendly format, along with visualizing multiple properties on heatmap for a more intuitive analysis.

I started my career in software with an intership at [Hexacta](https://hexacta.com/), one of the leaders in IT consulting and offshore software development in latin america.

During my intership, I was part of the Hexacta's Architecture Team, where we provided advice and solutions to Hexacta's technical project-managers on issues of architectural and design decisions, technologies and frameworks to use, improving product quality and productivity.

After finishing my intership, I joined multiple projects where I worked as a fullstack JS developer, building mainly MEAN applications.

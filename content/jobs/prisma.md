[Prisma](https://prisma.io/) is an open-source ORM for Node.js and TypeScript. I'm currently working as part of the Developer Productivity team, helping build [Prisma Data Platform](https://www.prisma.io/data-platform), a cloud-based product that makes the data infrastructure developed at large tech companies accessible to application developers.

Our team works in the management layer that handles project creation and configuration, project data visualization, collaborative workflows, user accounts, and billing and payment.

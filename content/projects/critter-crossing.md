March 2020, we were all at the beginning of the panini, looking for new hobbies and distractions. What a perfect time to escape to a deserted island and create your own paradise right? well, that was a perfect time for Nintendo to launch Animal Crossing: New Horizons. 

We were all living and breathing AC: looking for items and fruits, selling turnips and trying to complete the museum collection. The [AnimalCrossing Wiki](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/) was like my second home, but if you've used it, you know is not very mobile-friendly. So I decided to make use of my dev skills __(and free time)__ and create my own critterpedia wiki.

I created the project using create-react-app for the client app and Express for the scraper app. You can take a look at the finished product [here](https://cc.inama.dev/).

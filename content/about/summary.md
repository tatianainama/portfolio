Hey! I'm an Argentinian javascript developer living in The Netherlands.

I have a knack for functional programming and strong typing. I'm passionate about UX/UI design, you could say my skills hit the sweet spot between design and development.

Besides programming, I love spending my time cooking, taking care of my indoor jungle and walking my two wire fox terriers Taco & Chili.
